GradientSlider is a UIControl subclass which is similar to UISlider, but with a linear gradient coloring the slider’s track. Useful for creating color pickers. It is written in Swift 2 and requires it.

**Features**
- Easily define a gradient by setting the min & max (i.e. left & right) colors
- Rainbow gradients (with customizable saturation & brightness) for making Hue selection sliders
- IBDesignable/Inspectable for direct use within Interface Builder
- Add an icon or color to the slider thumb
- Min/Max images (similar to UISlider)
- Both Target/Action and Block-based callbacks
- Customizable track thickness
- Customizable track border and thumb size
- Looks like UISlider by default, so they can be intermixed in the UI

## Installation
Drag the “GradientSlider.swift” file into your Xcode project

## Usage via Interface Builder
Drag a custom view into your storyboard and change it’s class to “GradientSlider”. Use the attributes inspector to optionally set the slider’s basic properties:
- min/max color
- hasRainbow (Note: the min color’s saturation & brightness are used)
- value
- minimum/maximum value
- minimum/maximum images
- thickness
- thumbIcon

## Setting the Track Gradient Programmatically
### Min/Max Color
The track displays a linear gradient with the minColor corresponding to the minimumValue and the maxColor corresponding to the maximumValue. 

	slider.minValue = UIColor.blueColor()
	slider.maxValue = UIColor.orangeColor()

### Rainbow
When the `hasRainbow` property is set to true, the track displays a rainbow gradient which moves around the color wheel (starting and ending with red). The saturation & brightness are both pulled from the color in `minValue`.

	slider.minValue = UIColor.blueColor() //This has full saturation & brightness
	slider.hasRainbow = true

### Convenience Methods
Since one of the primary uses of the gradient sliders is to create color pickers, a few convenience methods have been provided for updating the colors.

**HSB**

`setGradientForHueWithSaturation(saturation:CGFloat,brightness:CGFloat)` This method sets the track to a rainbow gradient with the given saturation and brightness. This is useful for choosing a hue in the context of the current saturation and brightness settings.

`setGradientForSaturationWithHue(hue:CGFloat,brightness:CGFloat)` This method sets the track to a gradient varying from grey to fully saturated with the hue and brightness provided. This is useful for choosing a saturation value in the context of the current hue and brightness settings.

`setGradientForBrightnessWithHue(hue:CGFloat,saturation:CGFloat)` This method sets the track to a gradient varying from black to full brightness with the hue and saturation provided. This is useful for choosing a brightness value in the context of the current hue and saturation settings.

**RGB**

`setGradientForRedWithGreen(green:CGFloat, blue:CGFloat)` This method sets the track to a gradient with varying red for the given green & blue values.

`setGradientForGreenWithRed(red:CGFloat, blue:CGFloat)` This method sets the track to a gradient with varying green for the given red & blue values.

`setGradientForBlueWithRed(red:CGFloat, green:CGFloat)` This method sets the track to a gradient with varying blue for the given red & green values.

**Grayscale**

`setGradientForGrayscale()` This method sets the track to a gradient from black to white.

## Responding to User Interaction
### Target/Action
As a UIControl subclass, the traditional target/action approach is fully supported. The slider will send TouchDown, ValueChanged, and TouchUpInside actions. If the `continuous` property is set to true (which it is by default), then the slider will send ValueChanged actions as the slider changes, otherwise a ValueChanged action is only sent when the user releases the slider.

### ActionBlock
The slider will also call it’s actionBlock when its value is changed. If the `continuous` property is set to true (which it is by default), then the slider will call its actionBlock as the slider changes, otherwise it will only call it once when the slider is released.
The `actionBlock` property takes a closure which takes 2 parameters: The slider being changed and the new value, and has no return value. 
It’s signature is: `(GradientSlider,CGFloat)->()`

Here is an example of a hue slider which updates it’s own `thumbColor` to the value it is pointing to and updates sliders representing saturation & brightness to reflect it’s new value:

	//There are 3 @IBOutlets: hueSlide,satSlide, and brightSlide
	
	hueSlide.actionBlock = { slider, value in
		let curSat = satSlide.value
		let curBright = brightSlide.value
	
		//First disable animations so we get instantaneous updates
		CATransaction.begin()
	    CATransaction.setValue(true, forKey: kCATransactionDisableActions)
		
		//Reflect the new hue in the saturation slider
		satSlide.setGradientForSaturationWithHue(value, brightness:curBright)
		
		//Reflect the new hue in the brightness slider 
		brightSlide.setGradientForBrightnessWithHue(value, saturation:curSat) 
		
		//Update hueSlider's thumb color to match our new value
		slider.thumbColor = UIColor(hue: value, saturation: curSat, brightness: curBright, alpha: 1.0) 
		// (Note: We use the slider variable passed instead of 'hueSlide' to avoid retain cycles)
	    
	    CATransaction.commit()
	}

## Customizing the Track
Besides the background gradient, the track is customizable in several ways using the following properties:
- `thickness:CGFloat` This sets the track’s thickness. The default value is 2pts
- `borderColor:UIColor` This sets the color of the track’s border. The default value is black.
- `borderWidth:CGFloat` This sets the width of the track’s border. The default value is 0 (i.e. no border).
- `minimumValueImage:UIImage?` This places an image to the left of the track. Setting it to nil removes any image which is there. The default value is nil (i.e. no image).
- `maximumValueImage:UIImage?` This places an image to the right of the track. Setting it to nil removes any image which is there. The default value is nil (i.e. no image). 
	 
## Customizing the Thumb
The thumb can be resized, given a custom color or an icon (it can not have both a color and an icon at the same time). To customize the thumb, use the following properties:
- `thumbSize:CGFloat` This sets the diameter of the thumb. Note: Resizing the thumb may change the slider’s intrisicContentSize. The default is 28.0 pts.
- `thumbColor:UIColor` This sets the color displayed by the thumb. When the thumb has an associated icon, the color is automatically set to clearColor, and setting a new color removes the icon. The default value is White.
- `thumbIcon:UIImage?` This sets the image to display inside the slider’s thumb. Setting an image automatically removes the thumbColor, and setting a color removes the icon. The default value is nil (i.e. no image)
